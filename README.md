# Organogram and Tree Structure Builder

This application allows users to effortlessly create dynamic organograms and tree-like structures. Users have the ability to add children by simply clicking the plus button. Likewise, they can remove children with a click on the 'x' button, and toggle child visibility using the show/hide button.

For adding a child, an input field appears upon clicking, accompanied by a green confirmation button. At the top-right corner, three essential buttons (+, Reset, and -) facilitate zooming in, resetting, and zooming out respectively.

Additionally, the interface allows users to effortlessly drag elements within the tree.

Lastly, this was built with pure vanilla JavaScript and React, this project doesn't rely on any third-party libraries.
